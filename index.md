### CPSC 120
* Lab 12
    Lab 12 is actually really interesting cause we get the chance to create something like a gif for part 1 of lab 12. It's also meaningful cause it is the last lab we have for 120L.
* Lab 5
    Lab 5 did give me a hard time , specially part 2 which we have to work with a lot of function to calculate . So i think lab 5 really teach me a lot .
* Lab 8
    Lab 8 is the first time i get to work with stuffs like vectors , arguments ... At first, it seems a little annoying but it is really fun to do lab 8 and get more knowledge about the std::vector .
